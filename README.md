### What I need ?

Download the project, and inside the main folder, just run the follow command for dependences installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Test
In app.js file, I configurated the http PORT to 3000, you can change as you wanted, so, in this example, when start this example, it will be released in localhost:3000 address :)
